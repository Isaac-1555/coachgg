# CoachGG - Project Context & Implementation Guide

## 📋 Project Overview

CoachGG is a web application designed to help aspiring professional esports gamers improve their skills through stat tracking, AI coaching, and team collaboration. The platform consolidates solo and team competitive gaming experiences into a single, gamified ecosystem.

## 🎯 Vision & Goals

**Vision Statement:** "CoachGG empowers gamers to grow from casual players to competitive pros by turning data into insight, and insight into action."

**Key Objectives:**
- Achieve 5K active users within 6 months
- Maintain 85%+ match form submission rate
- Reduce player performance variance by 10% using AI coach feedback

## 👥 Target User Personas

1. **Solo Player (Kyle)** - Late-night Valorant/LoL player wanting to improve KDA and win rate
2. **Team Captain (Zara)** - College Dota 2 team manager needing performance history and compatibility reports
3. **Manager/Coach (Alex)** - Runs training groups for regional tournaments, needs calendar and performance tracking

## 📁 Reference Implementation

The `docs/coachgg-app/` folder contains a complete Next.js implementation with:
- TypeScript components (to be converted to JS)
- Tailwind CSS styling (to be converted to custom CSS)
- Complete UI/UX design
- Component structure and interactions
- **Note**: Contains dummy data - needs to be replaced with empty states and real API connections

## 🚀 Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Project setup and authentication
2. **Phase 2**: Core UI components and routing
3. **Phase 3**: Database integration and API development
4. **Phase 4**: Feature implementation (Solo, Team, Manager)
5. **Phase 5**: AI coach integration
6. **Phase 6**: Testing and deployment

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Use `.js` files and `.css` for styling (no TypeScript/Tailwind)
- Remove all dummy data from reference implementation
- Create empty states for all features
- Ensure proper database connectivity
- Implement real authentication flow
- Focus on creating a working MVP with actual data flow
